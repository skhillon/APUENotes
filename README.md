# APUENotes
Notes from *Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, 3rd Edition by Stevens & Rago* taken by Sarthak Khillon.

Definitions/keywords are provided in **bold type**, code/filepaths are `monospaced type`, and notes/other important information is stressed with *italics type*.

I skipped Chapter 2 because it wasn't immediately helpful for my midterm, but if you would like to contribute please submit a pull request :)
